    Martin Luther Speech 'I have a dream'

    <div class="grid">
        <div>
        I am happy to join with you today
         in what will go down in history 
        as the greatest demonstration for
         freedom in the history of our nation.

        Five score years ago, a great American,
         in whose symbolic shadow
         we stand today, signed the Emancipation
          Proclamation. This momentous decree came 
          as a great beacon light of hope to millions 
          of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames 
          of withering injustice. It came as a joyous 
          daybreak to end the long night of captivity.

        But one hundred years later, the Negro 
         is not free. One hundred
         years later, the life of the Negro is
          still sadly crippled by the manacles 
          of segregation and the chains of discrimination.
            One hundred years later, the Negro lives
            on a lonely island of poverty in the midst
             of a vast ocean of material prosperity.
              One hundred years later, the Negro is still
               languished in the corners of American society 
               and finds himself in exile in his own land. 
               So we have come here today to dramatize an shameful condition.

        In a sense we've come to our nation's 
        Capital to cash a check. When the
         architects of our republic wrote the 
         magnificent words of the Constitution and 
         the Declaration of Independence, they were
         signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.
